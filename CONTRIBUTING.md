## Contributing and Feedback

We are looking for feedback on the code implementation and overarching model framework associated with the BlueSky Prototype. You may provide feedback by emailing nextgenerationmodel@eia.gov. In specific, we would appreciate feedback aimed towards answering the following questions:

1.	How can we make it easier to understand the documentation, download the code, modify it, and run it?

2.	Are there general coding best-practices you have suggestions on?

3.	Is this code nimble and flexible enough to code up a next-generation energy model?

We appreciate your contributions and efforts to improve our project. Thank you for your collaboration!

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
